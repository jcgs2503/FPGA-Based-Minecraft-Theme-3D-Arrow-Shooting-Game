# FPGA Based Minecraft Theme 3D Arrow Shooting Game

In our final project, we designed and built a semi-3D first person shooting game by implementing a raycasting engine on the FPGA board. This semi-3D fps game is based on Minecraft texture with basic Minecraft blocks that can be randomly generated through software during initialization. Semi-3D means that the player is actually still in a 2D space, in which Steve can only walk forward/ backward/ left/ right and rotate his head horizontally, however, the casting of walls and skeletons will make the visual appears like a 3D game. Player is able to shoot skeletons randomly generated across the map to accumulate scores. Every time Steve respawns, he will have 10 hearts indicating current health and whenever he gets hit by an arrow, one heart will be deducted.
